# Project Description
Our hackathon project is a webapp called ToDo with Canvas. The user interface was made using HTML, CSS and Javascript and the backend processes were made with Flask. It serves as a tool for users to get a better view of what canvas assignments they have due. It also has a notes section for users to write down any important reminders or information regarding their assignments.

# The Todo List
The todo list portion of the application uses the canvas api to directly get the users assignments and lists them based on close the due date is. Users can also check off which assignments they have completed.

# The Notes
The notes portion of the application allows the user to generate sqaure sticky notes that are organized in a grid pattern. To create a note the user must click on the box with the plus sign and to delete a note the user must double click on an existing note and accept the prompt asking if they are sure they want to delete the note.
